The BandwidthControls type defines the format for configuring media and/or track bandwidth options.
BandwidthControls only affect received remote tracks of the specified type.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `call` **[number][12]?** The desired combined bandwidth bitrate in kilobits per second for all media in the call.
-   `audio` **[number][12]?** The desired bandwidth bitrate in kilobits per second for received remote audio.
-   `video` **[number][12]?** The desired bandwidth bitrate in kilobits per second for received remote video.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Specify received remote video bandwidth limits when making a call.
client.call.make(destination, mediaConstraints,
 {
   bandwidth: {
     video: 5
   }
 }
)
```

### hold

Puts a call on hold.

The specified call to hold must not already be locally held. Any/all
   media received from the remote participant will stop being received,
   and any/all media being sent to the remote participant will stop
   being sent.

Some call operations cannot be performed while the call is on hold. The
   call can be taken off hold with the [call.unhold][37] API.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][39]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][39] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to hold.

### unhold

Takes a call off hold.

The specified call to unhold must be locally held. If the call is not
   also remotely held, call media will be reconnected as it was before
   the call was held.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][39]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][39] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to unhold.

### setCustomParameters

Set the custom parameters of a call.

The specified parameters will be saved as part of the call's information throughout the duration of the call.
All subsequent call operations will include these custom parameters.
Therefore, invalid parameters, or parameters not previously configured on the server, will cause subsequent call operations to fail.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][33],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

The custom parameters set on a call can be sent directly with the [call.sendCustomParameters][31] API.

Custom parameters can be removed from a call's information by setting them as undefined (e.g., `call.setCustomParameters(callId)`).
Subsequent call operations will no longer send custom parameters.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.
-   `customParameters` **[Array][13]&lt;[call.CustomParameter][22]>** The custom parameters to set.

### sendCustomParameters

Send the custom parameters on an ongoing call to the server. The server may either consume the headers or relay them
to another endpoint, depending on how the server is configured.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][33],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

To change or remove the custom parameters on a call, use the [call.setCustomParameters][30] API.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call being acted on.

### getAll

Retrieves the information of all calls made during the current session.

**Examples**

```javascript
let calls = client.call.getAll()
let currentCalls = calls.filter(call => {
    return call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED
})
```

Returns **[Array][13]&lt;[call.CallObject][40]>** Call objects.

### getById

Retrieves the information of a single call with a specific call ID.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to retrieve.

Returns **[call.CallObject][40]** A call object.

### end

Ends an ongoing call.

The SDK will stop any/all local media associated with the call. Events
   will be emitted to indicate which media tracks were stopped. See the
   [call:trackEnded][41] event for more
   information.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][39]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][39] event, that the
   call was ended.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to end.

### addMedia

Add new media tracks to an ongoing call.
Will get new media tracks from the specific sources to add to the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][42] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to add media to.
-   `media` **[Object][7]** The media options to add to the call. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to add audio to the call. (optional, default `false`)

### removeMedia

Remove tracks from an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][41]
   event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
   has been removed.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to remove media from.
-   `tracks` **[Array][13]** A list of track IDs to remove.
-   `options` **[Object][7]?**  (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.bandwidth` **[call.BandwidthControls][21]?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.

### startVideo

Adds local video to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call does not
   already have video. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.addMedia][44] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][42] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.

    -   `options.dscpControls` **[call.DSCPControls][43]?** Options for configuring DSCP markings on the media traffic.

### stopVideo

Removes local video from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being sent
   to the remote participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call has only one
   video track. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.removeMedia][45] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][41]
   event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
   has been removed.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.

### startScreenshare

Adds local screenshare to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.addMedia][44] API can be used to perform the same behaviour
   as `startScreenshare`. [call.addMedia][44] is a general-purpose API
   for adding media to a call, which covers the same functionality as
   `startScreenshare`. Selecting only screen options when using
   [call.addMedia][44] will perform the same behaviour as using
   `startScreenshare`.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Select media options for adding only screenshare.
const media = {
   audio: false,
   video: false,
   screen: true,
   screenOptions: { ... }
}

// Add the selected media to the call.
client.call.addMedia(callId, media)
```

### stopScreenshare

Removes local screenshare from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being
   sent to the remote participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.removeMedia][45] API can be used to perform the same
   behaviour as `stopScreenshare`. [call.removeMedia][45] is a
   general-purpose API for removing media from a call, which covers the
   same functionality as `stopScreenshare`. Specifying only the screen
   track when using [call.removeMedia][45] will perform the same
   behaviour as using `stopScreenshare`.

There is a caveat that if a Call has multiple video tracks (for example,
   both a video and a screen track), the SDK itself cannot yet
   differentiate one from the other. The application will need to know
   which track was the screen track in this scenario.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of any/all video tracks on the call.
const videoTracks = call.localTracks.filter(trackId => {
   const track = call.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   // Both video and screen tracks have kind of 'video'.
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Pick out the screen track.
const screenTrack = videoTracks[0]

// Remove screen from the call.
client.call.removeMedia(callId, [ screenTrack ])
```

### sendDTMF

Send DTMF tones to a call's audio.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
   sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
   other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
   state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
   otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `tone` **[string][8]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid chracters are ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','*' and ','].
-   `duration` **[number][12]** The amount of time, in milliseconds, that each DTMF tone should last. (optional, default `100`)
-   `intertoneGap` **[number][12]** The length of time, in milliseconds, to wait between tones. (optional, default `70`)

### getStats

Get a report about low-level call statistical information.

A Track ID can optionally be provided to get a report for a specific
   Track of the Call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:statsReceived][46] event, after
   the operation completes, that has the report.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call to retrieve the report.
-   `trackId` **[string][8]?** ID of a Track being used by the Call. If not
       provided, RTCStatsReport is generated for the Call itself.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][38] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][47] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][7]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][7]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][20]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][7]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][20]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **[call.MediaConstraint][20]?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **[call.MediaConstraint][20]?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[call.MediaConstraint][20]?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Can also replace the specified video track of the call with a new
// screen sharing track because screen sharing is delivered as a video stream to remote peer.
// User will then be prompted to pick a specific screen to share and thus the device id will be selected.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a screen sharing track.
  // Note that 'screenOptions' property is not mandatory, as API will use default values
  // for properties like: width, height, frameRate.
  screen: true
})
```

### getAvailableCodecs

Retrieve the list of available and supported codecs based on the browser's capabilities for sending media.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, it will contain the list of available and supported codecs.
In addition, the SDK emits a [call:availableCodecs][48] event
 upon retrieving that list of codecs.

This API is a wrapper for the static method [RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities()][49].
 Firefox browser does not currently support this method. Therefore, this API will not work on Firefox.

**Parameters**

-   `kind` **[string][8]** The kind of media, i.e., 'audio' or 'video', to get the list of available codecs of.

### setSdpHandlers

Set [SDP Handler Functions][50] that will be run as part of a pipeline for all future calls.
 This will replace any SDP Handlers that were previously set.

SDP handlers can be used to make modifications to the SDP (e.g., removing certain codecs)
 before they are processed or sent to the other side.

This is an advanced feature, changing the SDP handlers mid-call may cause
 unexpected behaviour in future call operations for that call.

**Parameters**

-   `sdpHandlers` **[Array][13]&lt;[call.SdpHandlerFunction][16]>** The list of SDP handler functions to modify SDP.

### setDefaultDevices

The `setDefaultDevices` API from previous SDK releases (3.X) has been
   deprecated in the latest releases (4.X+). The SDK no longer keeps
   track of "default devices" on behalf of the application.

The devices used for a call can be selected as part of the APIs for
   starting the call. Microphone and/or camera can be chosen in the
   [call.make][28] and [call.answer][29] APIs, and speaker can be
   chosen when the audio track is rendered with the
   [media.renderTracks][51] API.

### changeInputDevices

Changes the camera and/or microphone used for a Call's media input.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeInputDevices` API can be implemented
   using the general-purpose [call.replaceTrack][52] API. This API can
   be used to replace an existing media track with a new track of the
   same type, allowing an application to change certain aspects of the
   media, such as input device.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's video track.
const videoTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Select the new video options.
const media = {
   video: true,
   videoOptions: {
       deviceId: 'cameraId'
   }
}

// Change the call's camera by replacing the video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack, media)
```

### changeSpeaker

Changes the speaker used for a Call's audio output. Supported on
   browser's that support HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId().

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeSpeaker` API can be implemented by
   re-rendering the Call's audio track.  A speaker can be selected when
   rendering an audio track, so changing a speaker can be simulated
   by unrendering the track with [media.removeTracks][53], then
   re-rendering it with a new speaker with [media.renderTracks][51].

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's audio track.
const audioTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'audio'
})

// Where the audio track was previously rendered.
const audioContainer = ...

// Unrender the audio track we want to change speaker for.
client.media.removeTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer)
// Re-render the audio track with a new speaker.
client.media.renderTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer, {
   speakerId: 'speakerId'
})
```

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.
Unless stated otherwise, the Call's state pertains to both caller & callee.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][33],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][39]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][8]** The (outgoing) call is being started. While in this state, no Call operations can be performed until Call gets into Initiated state.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][8]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received. This is a state valid only for caller's side.
-   `RINGING` **[string][8]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][8]** The call has not been answered, but media
       is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
       system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
       supported, this state may replace the Ringing state. This is a state valid only for caller's side.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][8]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered. This is a state valid only for callee's side.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][8]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // The call is now active, and can perform midcall operations.
   }
})
```

## connection

The 'connection' namespace is used to connect and maintain connections between
the SDK and one or more backend servers.

### getSocketState

Get the state of the websocket.

**Parameters**

-   `platform` **[string][8]** Backend platform for which to request the websocket's state. (optional, default `'link'`)

### enableConnectivityChecking

Enables or disables connectivity checking.

**Parameters**

-   `enable` **[boolean][11]** Enable connectivity checking.

## logger

The SDK has an internal logging system for providing information about its
   behaviour. The SDK will generate logs, at different levels for different
   types of information, which are routed to a
   "[Log Handler][4]" for consumption. An application
   can provide their own Log Handler (see
   [config.logs][54]) to customize how the logs are
   handled, or allow the default Log Handler to print the logs to the
   console.

The SDK's default Log Handler is merely a thin wrapper around the browser's
   console API (ie. `window.console`). It receives the log generated by the
   SDK, called a "[Log Entry][5]", formats a
   human-readable message with it, then uses the console to log it at the
   appropriate level. This is important to be aware of, since your browser's
   console may affect how you see the SDK's default log messages. Since the
   default Log Handler uses the console's levels, the browser may filter
   which messages are shown depending on which levels it has configured. For
   a user that understands console log levels, this can be helpful for
   filtering the logs to only the relevant information. But it can equally
   be a hindrance by hiding the more detailed log messages (at the 'debug'
   level), since browser can have this level hidden by default. For this
   reason, we recommend providing a custom Log Handler to the SDK that is
   better suited for your application and its users.

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

The SDK will provide [Log Entries][5] to the
   [Log Handler][4] for all logs at or above the set
   log level. 'debug' is considered the lowest level and 'silent' the
   highest level. For example, if the current level is 'info', then the
   [Log Handler][4] will receive
   [Log Entries][5] for logs at 'info', 'warn', and
   'error', but not for the 'debug' level.

**Properties**

-   `SILENT` **[string][8]** Nothing will be logged.
-   `ERROR` **[string][8]** Unhandled error information will be logged. If
       the SDK encounters an issue it cannot resolve, the error will be included
       in the logs. This likely points to an issue with the SDK itself or an
       issue with how the SDK is being used.
-   `WARN` **[string][8]** Warning messages for the application developer will
       be logged. If the SDK encounters an issue that it can recover and continue,
       a warning about the issue will be included in the logs. These logs point
       to issues that need to be handled by the application. For example, providing
       an invalid configuration to the SDK will cause a warning log that explains
       the issue.
-   `INFO` **[string][8]** General information about the SDK's operations will
       be logged, outlining how the SDK is handling the operations. Reading through
       these logs should provide a high-level view of what the SDK is doing,
       and why it is doing it.
-   `DEBUG` **[string][8]** Detailed information about the SDK's operations,
       meant for debugging issues, will be logged. Specific information and relevant
       operation data are provided for understanding the scenario that the SDK
       was in during the operation.

### LogHandler

A LogHandler can be used to customize how the SDK should log information. By
   default, the SDK will log information to the console, but a LogHandler can
   be configured to change this behaviour.

A LogHandler can be provided to the SDK as part of its configuration (see
   [config.logs][54]). The SDK will then provide this
   function with the logged information.

Type: [Function][15]

**Parameters**

-   `LogEntry` **[Object][7]** The LogEntry to be logged.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Define a custom function to handle logs.
function logHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}

// Provide the LogHandler as part of the SDK configurations.
const configs = { ... }
configs.logs.handler = logHandler
const client = create(configs)
```

### LogEntry

A LogEntry object is the data that the SDK compiles when information is
   logged. It contains both the logged information and meta-info about when
   and who logged it.

A [LogHandler][4] provided to the SDK (see
   [config.logs][54]) will need to handle LogEntry
   objects.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][12]** When the log was created, based on UNIX epoch.
-   `method` **[string][8]** The log function that was used to create the log.
-   `level` **[string][8]** The level of severity the log.
-   `target` **[Object][7]** The subject that the log is about.
    -   `target.type` **[string][8]** The type of the target. This is also
           used as part of the name of the Logger.
    -   `target.id` **[string][8]?** A unique identifer for the target.
    -   `target.name` **[string][8]** A combination of the target type and ID. If no
           id was provided, this will be the same as the type.
-   `messages` **[Array][13]** The logged information, given to the Logger
       method as parameters.
-   `timer` **[Object][7]?** Timing data, if the log method was a timer method.

**Examples**

```javascript
function defaultLogHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}
```

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used in conjunction with the [Calls][55]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][56] API.

### getDevices

Retrieves the available media devices for use.

The [devices:change][57] event will be
   emitted when the available media devices have changed.

Returns **[Object][7]** The lists of camera, microphone, and speaker devices.

### getById

Retrieves an available Media object with a specific Media ID.

**Parameters**

-   `mediaId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Media to retrieve.

Returns **[call.MediaObject][58]** A Media object.

### getTrackById

Retrieve an available Track object with a specific Track ID.

**Parameters**

-   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Track to retrieve.

Returns **[call.TrackObject][36]** A Track object.

### initializeDevices

Requests permission to access media devices on the end-user's machine.

This API will trigger the browser to ask the end-user for permission to
   access their camera and/or microphone. These permissions are
   needed for the SDK to read information about the devices (the label,
   for example) and for using the devices for a call.

If the browser does not yet have permission, it will prompt the end-user
   with a small pop-up window, giving the user a chance to allow/deny the
   permissions. The behaviour of this pop-up window differs slightly
   based on the browser; it may automatically save the user's decision
   (such as in Chrome and Safari) or it may require the user to choose
   whether their decision should be saved (such as in Firefox).

This API is not required for proper usage of media and/or calls, but
   helps to prepare a user before a call is made or received. It allows
   an application to prompt the user for device permissions when it is
   convenient for them, rather than during call setup. If the user saves
   their decision, they will not be prompted again when the SDK accesses
   those devices for a call.

For device information, the [media.getDevices][56] API will retrieve
   the list of media devices available for the SDK to use. If this list
   is empty, or is missing information, it is likely that the browser
   does not have permission to access the device's information. We
   recommend using the [media.initializeDevices][59] API in this
   scenario if you would like to allow the end-user to select which
   device(s) they would like to use when they make a call, rather than
   using the system default.

The SDK will emit a [devices:change][57]
   event when the operation is successful or a
   [devices:error][60] event if an error is
   encountered.

**Parameters**

-   `constraints` **[Object][7]?** 
    -   `constraints.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for audio device permissions. (optional, default `true`)
    -   `constraints.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for video device permissions. (optional, default `true`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// The SDK will ask for both audio and video permissions by default.
client.media.initializeDevices()

// The SDK will only ask for audio permissions.
client.media.initializeDevices({ audio: true, video: false })
```

### renderTracks

Render Media Tracks in a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][13]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to be rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.
-   `options` **[Object][7]?** Additional options for rendering the tracks.
    -   `options.speakerId` **[string][8]?** The speaker's Device ID to use for audio tracks.

**Examples**

```javascript
// When a Call receives a new track, render it.
client.on('call:newTrack', function (params) {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(params.trackId)
   const container = params.local ? localContainer : remoteContainer

   // Render the Call's new track when it first becomes available.
   client.media.renderTracks([ track.trackId ], container)
})
```

### removeTracks

Remove Media Tracks from a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][13]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to stop being rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.

### muteTracks

Mutes the specified Tracks at their media source.

Prevents media from being received for the Tracks. Audio Tracks will
   become silent and video Tracks will be a black frame.

If a local Track being sent in a Call is muted, the Track will be
   noticeably muted for the remote user. If a remote Track received in a
   call is muted, the result will only be noticeable locally.

The SDK will emit a [media:muted][61] event
   when a Track has been muted.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][13]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

### unmuteTracks

Unmutes the specified Tracks.

Media will resume as normal for the Tracks.

The SDK will emit a [media:unmuted][62] event
   when a Track has been unmuted.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][13]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

**Parameters**

-   `enable` **[boolean][11]** Whether the websocket channel should be enabled.

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][50]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios.

Note that SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They can be added during
initialization of the SDK using the [config.call.sdpHandlers][65] configuration
parameter. They can also be set after the SDK's creation by using the
[call.setSdpHandlers][66] function.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

```javascript
// Through the Call API post-instantiation
client.call.setSdpHandlers([ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...])
```

### createCodecRemover

This function creates an SDP handler that will remove codecs matching the selectors specified for SDP offers and answers.

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to remote parties. For example, some legacy call services limit the SDP
length (usually to 4KB) and will reject calls that have SDP size above this amount.

While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the createCodecRemover function creates a codec removal handler that can be used for this purpose. Applications can use this codec
removal handler in combination with the [call.getAvailableCodecs][67] function in order to build logic to determine the best codecs to use
for their application.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **([Array][13]&lt;CodecSelector> | [Array][13]&lt;[string][8]>)** A list of codec selectors to remove from the SDP. If passing a list of strings, they will be converted into
                                                         codec selectors that correspond to those names without any extra FMTP parameters.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';

const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover([
  // Remove all VP8 and VP9 codecs.
  'VP8',
  'VP9',

  // Remove all H264 codecs with the specified FMTP parameters.
  {
    name: 'H264',
    fmtpParams: ['profile-level-id=4d0032', 'packetization-mode=1']
  }
])

const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **[call.SdpHandlerFunction][16]** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

### CodecSelector

An object that represents a selector to match codecs of an RTP map in SDP.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `name` **[string][8]** The name of the codec.
-   `fmtpParams` **[Array][13]&lt;[string][8]>** An array of strings to match against the "a=fmtp" format parameters for the corresponding codec.
                                         All of the elements in the array must be contained in the "a=fmtp" attribute in order to be a match.
